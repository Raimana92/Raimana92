# About me

Hi you, :wave:

I am Raimana92, I am actually studying in France on Computer Science (B2). 

I love Programming :computer:, the Cybersecurity:closed_lock_with_key:, Networking :link: and Web development :chart_with_upwards_trend:.

All this account is about saving most of the projects from school. Some are just tests.
